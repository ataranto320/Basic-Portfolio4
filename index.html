                    Hi, my name is Austin Taranto. I am a self proclaimed nerd who is trying to make a drastic change of direction in life. 
    
                    I love all things Star Wars, Marvel, NASA, and anything science related. I am a movie fanatic and can quote most pop culture movies. 
    
                    I also enjoy video games, especially adventure games with puzzle solving voven into the story.
    
                    Also be fare warned, my humor is super DRY with a big emphasise on the dry.
    
                </p>

                    After studying business in college I got my first real job in sales at Discovery Communications. I learned that sales wasn't for me and then did some soul searching. Being I liked movies, I decided to get into production.
    
                    But since then I have come to find that may that field isn't for me and am looking to make a drastic change. After learning about coding from a friend and trying it out, it seems that I may have a knack for this coding thing.
    
                    I am still in the early stages of learning and can find things to be frustrating at times. Especially ternimal and github, but I will persist on and work towards making a real change for the better. 
    
                    Or I could always fall back on working the corner at night.
